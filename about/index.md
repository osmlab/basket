OpenStreetMap Basket features a collection of case studies and lessons learned from government, multilateral and non-profit institutions who use and contribute to OSM in their official line of work. We invite you to take a look or submit a case study of your own, and we hope you’ll learn something from our experiences using OSM to shape policy and strengthen field projects. 

Basket is maintained by the OSM Institutions community of practice, whose members include {% for author in site.data.authors %} {{ author.name }}
{% if forloop.last == false %}, {% else %} and {% endif %}{% endfor %}.
